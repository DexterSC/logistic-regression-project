# Logistic Regression Project

This is a supervised machine learning project completed as part of Jose Portilla's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp on Udemy. The goal was to apply **logistic regression** to a binary classification problem, evaluate the model’s performance, and gain hands-on experience with key concepts like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I:

- Explored and preprocessed the dataset
- Built a logistic regression classifier using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics and visualizations
- Interpreted the results to understand model strengths and weaknesses

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Logistic Regression
- Train-test splitting
- Data preprocessing
- Model evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy)
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix

## 📊 Results

The model achieved the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 90%
- **Precision**: 0.86 (class 0), 0.95 (class 1)
- **Recall**: 0.96 (class 0), 0.85 (class 1)
- **F1-Score**: 0.91 (class 0), 0.90 (class 1)

These results indicate a well-performing logistic regression model with slightly better precision on class 1 and better recall on class 0.
